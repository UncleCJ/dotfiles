# EurKEY-Mac modified

The macOS Keyboard Layout for Europeans, Coders and Translators. If you are looking for the _offical_ layout, check out the [release page](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/EurKEY-Mac/releases) and download [v1.3](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/EurKEY-Mac/releases/tag/v1.3).

Additionally, this repo contains a modified verison ([v1.4](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/EurKEY-Mac/releases/tag/v1.4)) of the layout, where the superscript numbers are written by pressing SHIFT and the subscript numbers without pressing SHIFT. 

This is a port of the [EurKEY Keyboard layout](http://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/), which features a QWERTY baseline layout (=good access to braces etc.) with quick access to commonly used accented characters and Umlauts.

Please report if you find any missing characters.
